------ Constructor ------

1. A Constructor is a Member function of a class -- Constructor is like taking properties
2. A Constructor is used to initialization
3. We use this keyword to denote a object in a constructor.
4. There are 2 different types of constructors
        a. Default constructor -- When system creates an Constructor
        b. Constructor with Parameter
        c. Constructor without Parameter


5. Java Constructor vs Java Method
    1a. Constructor is used to initialize the state of an object
    1b. Method is used to expose the Behaviour of the Object

    2a. Constructor must not have a return type
    2b. Method should have a return type

    3a. Constructor is invoked implicitly. (For an Object Constructor will be automatically generated)
    3b. Method is invoked Explicitly. (User has to define)

    4a. Java Compiler provides default constructor if it was not there.
    4b. Java Compiler doesn't provide default.

6. Encapsulation is the process of combining properties and methods inside a class
   Example:  Powdered Medicine in side a capsules
7. Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal working of a complex process
   1. data Abstraction
   2. Process abstraction
