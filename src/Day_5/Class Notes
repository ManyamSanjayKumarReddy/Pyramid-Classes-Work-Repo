Arrays --

1. It is a Derived Datatype.
2. We Can store multiple values in an array.
3. Elements are Placed contiguously.
4. It is a static allocation - Once the array size is fixed it can't be changed later.
5. Real Time Examples of Array :
    a. Array of Maruti Cars in a Showroom.
    b. Array of 3rd year students in a Row.
    c. Array of c++ Books in Row.
6. Every array is identified by it's Name.
7. Every Array has a unique name identified by it's datatype.
    ex : int[5] a = {3,5,6,7,8};
         int stands for Datatype
         a stands for array Name
         5 stands for Size of the Array
8. 1 2 3 -- Linear set of Elements
9. Each and Every element in the Array is identified by it's sub Script or Index Position.
10. int a[3] = {4,5,6} -- a[0] = 4, a[1] = 5, a[2] = 6
11. If array contains N elements; then the index range is from (0 to N-1)
    Ex : N = 3; range of index is (0 to 2)
12. The No.of Elements in an array should be equal to the size of array.
    int a[2] = {8, 9 , 1} -- Wrong Approach
    -- The Number of elements exceeded the array size
    int a[3] = {8} -- Although the compiler accepts it; This is not the Correct Approach
                      Because the memory is wasted.
 Types of Arrays:
----------------
1. Integer array
2. char array

char array
char array consists of set of characters
another name is string

char m={'a''e''o''u'}
      m[0]='a' m[1]='e' m[2]='0' m[3]='u'

**  \0 null value added to the end of every character array

 Operations in an array
 ----------------------
 1. Finding the length of the array
 2. Finding the maximum value in an array
 3. Finding the minimum value in an array
 4. Finding the duplicate elements in an array
 5. Sorting the array.

 Difference b/w one dimensional array & Two dimensional array
 One dimensional array -> single row of data
 Two dimensional array -> rows and columns

 1. In an Exam scenario -> student roll/student name.
 2. Weather forecasting -> Temperature and location

MCQ Questions in Array :

1. How many builtin function used in this program?
A. array.sort
        .toString

2. What is the default package use ?
A. Java.util.arrays;

3. What happen if array size is not specified?
A. once the elements declared in array the java compiler automatically takes the size by default

4. Why to.String function is used?
A. This is a function used to calculate the elements in array that is numeric and
    pass it as a string arguments generally this function is used to convert given
     numbers to string.


Sting Concepts :
------
String is a collection of characters every string is java uses string class operations
in a string.

String length -> Finding out the no.of characters in string
   Ex: string s='hello' -> str.length => 5

sting compare -> comparing one string with another
    Ex: str="hai" string str2="hello"
        str1=str2(not equal)

string concatenation -> combining string with another
     Ex: * String str="welcome" String str1="Welcome"
           str==str1(no not equal)
         * String str1='hai' String str2='hei'
           str1==str2(NO)
         * String str1="good" String str2="good"
           str1==str2(Yes)


String concatenation
--------------------
-> Combining the strings
-> Real time -> First name+last name of a student


** All strings in java are mutable(Changeable) - provided it is used along with string builder classes

** Length is used to find the number of characters in a string


Work
-----
* Develop the mini project for voting system using string functions *
