** Sorting

1. Bubble Sort is an Simple Sorting Algorithm which is based on Comparison in
    which each pair of adjacent elements is compared & the elements are swapped if they are not in order.

    ** This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and
            worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2) where n is the number of items.
